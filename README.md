# Webpack Preact App with HMR with PHP

*This is simply a VERY stripped down version of the
[preact-boilerplate](https://github.com/developit/preact-boilerplate) by @developit
that only tests using PHP as a platform for Preact/Webpack to run on.*

This project is going to include a Dockerfile to run a small instance
of PHP on, just for demonstration purposes. It's recommended to use this project with **caution!**


## Install

...Coming soon.
